# What is the project?

It's a project based on [Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). This is a first solo project from module one. We are free to create it with our own way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Problems and The Solutions

I got hard time to maintain the icon between on cta button. The `email button` and `LinkedIn button` looks similar but it's not. The position between icons and texts are not align. Had try solutions out there yet, none of them work. By the time, this project deploy I'm gonna find the solution dan solved immediately.

Another problem that I faced was icons for the footer. I used `png` file and it turn out it cannot changed the color. What I have was a black and white icon. When I try to change the color using `color` or `filter` in a css it didn't work.

The solution that I made was add some `:hover` and `:focus` to icons. So, every button and icons in this projects will change their colors when you hover to them. This is also important for the accessibility. I'm trying to make it inclusive as posibble so everyone can try it.

### Lesson Learned

I gotta learn on how icon and text can work together. Considering about the accesibillity when people using screen reader. Also, get to know more about using an image file type such as `.svg`, `.png`, and others for projects. What are the distinguished between them. How the choose what kind of type file do you want to use.
